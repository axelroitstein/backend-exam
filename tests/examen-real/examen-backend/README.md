# My API

The goal of this project is to put my backend skills to the test when it comes to developing and implementing a complete CRUD for a music-oriented REST API, which has 4 models made with Prisma. These models are named: Songs, Users, Artists and Albums.

I was aboarding several topics while working on it, such as:

## How to create and run a server

<img src = "image.png" alt = "Server code" width = "700" height = "500">

<img src = "image-1.png" alt = "Server in console" height = "500">

## Routing - How to create and use routes

<img src = "image-5.png" alt = "Routing files">

Example of a route:

<img src = "image-6.png" alt = "Route example">

## How to add functionality thanks to controllers:

<img src = "image-7.png" alt = "Controller files">

## Middlewares and validations for extra layers of security:

<img src = "image-8.png" alt = "Middleware and validation files">

These are the folders and files i've used for my project:

<img src = "image-4.png" alt = "Folders and files">
